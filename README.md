This project contains a single Jupyter notebook that trains and evaluates a plant species classification model using image data. The notebook includes data preprocessing, model building, training, and prediction examples—all in one place.

Contents
1. Data loading & preprocessing
2. CNN model training
3. Accuracy evaluation
4. Sample predictions

How to Run
1. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Open the notebook:
jupyter notebook Plant_detector.ipynb

Dataset
Plant Pathology 2020 Kaggle Dataset - [https://www.kaggle.com/code/tarunpaparaju/plant-pathology-2020-eda-models]
Add your dataset in the project folder or update the path in the notebook.

🔮 Future Work
1. Add more plant classes
2. Improve model accuracy
3. Convert to a web or mobile app
